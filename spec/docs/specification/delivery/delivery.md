# Delivery Capability

* **Capability Name:** `xyz.localprotocol.delivery`
* **Version:** `2026-01-19`

## Overview

The delivery capability provides a standalone API for on-demand delivery,
including delivery quote retrieval, delivery creation, and lifecycle tracking.
It is designed to power restaurant delivery flows and any other use case where
pickup + dropoff logistics are handled by a delivery platform.

The delivery service endpoint is discovered via `/.well-known/ucp` in:

* `services["xyz.localprotocol.delivery"].rest.endpoint`

### Payment Requirement (Standalone)

Delivery is standalone (no shopping checkout required), but **payment is
mandatory** for delivery creation. Platforms MUST:

1. Fetch `payment.handlers` from the delivery quote response.
2. Acquire a payment instrument using the handler specification.
3. Submit `payment_data` when creating the delivery.

This mirrors the UCP payment handler model, but applies it to delivery quotes
and delivery creation instead of checkout completion.

See:

- [Payment Handler Guide](../payment-handler-guide.md)
- [Payment Handler Template](../payment-handler-template.md)
- [Tokenization Guide](../tokenization-guide.md)
- [Platform Tokenizer Example](../examples/platform-tokenizer-payment-handler.md)
- [Business Tokenizer Example](../examples/business-tokenizer-payment-handler.md)
- [Encrypted Credential Example](../examples/encrypted-credential-handler.md)
- [Localprotocol Auth/Capture Example](../examples/localprotocol-auth-capture-handler.md)

### Handler Patterns for Delivery

Delivery fees are often captured after fulfillment. Common patterns:

- **Authorize/Capture** for delivery-friendly timing and escrow.
- **Processor Tokenizer** when PSP tokenizes and processes without detokenize.
- **Platform Tokenizer / Encrypted Credential** when platforms operate a
  compliant credential provider and hand off secure payloads.

## Quote Retrieval Flow

Delivery quotes let platforms price and validate on-demand delivery before
checkout completion. Quotes are time-bound and must be refreshed when expired.

**Request:**

* Use `delivery_request` with pickup, dropoff, timing, and items value.
* Optionally include `context` to resolve region/market preferences.

**Response:**

* `quote_id` is required for subsequent reference.
* `expires_at` indicates quote validity window.
* `totals` contain delivery pricing.

**Quote Refresh:**

* If `expires_at` is in the past, request a new quote.
* Embedded clients may receive `ed.delivery.quote_change` events.

### Quote Request Example

```json
{
  "delivery_request": {
    "pickup": {
      "id": "store_1",
      "title": "Downtown Store",
      "address": {
        "street_address": "123 Main St",
        "address_locality": "Springfield",
        "address_region": "IL",
        "postal_code": "62701",
        "address_country": "US"
      }
    },
    "dropoff": {
      "id": "dropoff_1",
      "recipient_name": "Alex Smith",
      "address": {
        "street_address": "456 Oak Ave",
        "address_locality": "Springfield",
        "address_region": "IL",
        "postal_code": "62701",
        "address_country": "US"
      }
    },
    "pickup_ready_dt": "2026-01-30T18:05:00Z",
    "dropoff_deadline_dt": "2026-01-30T19:00:00Z",
    "items_value": {
      "amount": 4599,
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    "external_store_id": "store_1"
  }
}
```

### Quote Response Example

```json
{
  "ucp": {
    "version": "2026-01-19",
    "capabilities": [
      { "name": "xyz.localprotocol.delivery", "version": "2026-01-19" }
    ]
  },
  "quote": {
    "quote_id": "quote_123",
    "expires_at": "2026-01-30T18:30:00Z",
    "totals": [
      { "type": "subtotal", "amount": 599 },
      { "type": "tax", "amount": 48 },
      { "type": "total", "amount": 647 }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Delivery Lifecycle

Deliveries are created using a `delivery_request` (same structure as quote
inputs). Once created, the delivery progresses through status updates and can
be tracked via polling or events.

### Status Progression (Typical)

```
pending → pickup → pickup_complete → dropoff → delivered
```

### Other Statuses

* `canceled` — delivery was canceled before completion
* `returned` — delivery failed and was returned
* `ongoing` — in-progress but does not map to a specific step

### Event Tracking

Delivery event payloads use the same status enum and include the current
delivery snapshot:

* Webhook: `delivery_event_webhook` (REST)
* Embedded: `ed.delivery.event`, `ed.delivery.change`

## Operations
